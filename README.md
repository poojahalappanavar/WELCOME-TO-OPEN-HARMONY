# WELCOME-TO-OPEN-HARMONY
OpenHarmony is an open-source project launched by the OpenAtom Foundation, and serves as an open-source, distributed operating system (OS) that is intended to address all conceivable usage scenarios. OpenHarmony is an open-source version of HarmonyOS.
HarmonyOS is a future-proof distributed operating system open to you as part of the initiatives for the all-scenario strategy, adaptable to mobile office, fitness and health, social communication, and media entertainment, and so on. Unlike a legacy operating system that runs on a standalone device, HarmonyOS is built on a distributed architecture designed based on a set of system capabilities. It is able to run on a wide range of device forms, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, PCs, smart TVs, AI speakers, head units, earphones, and AR/VR glasses.

##Motivation
The tradition Oss are limited to a specific type of device, OpenHarmony provides distributed features that are compatible with a wide range of different devices. The first version supports devices with 128 KB to 128 MB of memory. Join us as we keep updating OpenHarmony versions.
For device developers, OpenHarmony utilizes a component-based design to tailor its features to better suit specific devices, based on each device's capabilities and service characteristics. OpenHarmony can run on devices with limited resources and wearables with hundreds of KB of memory, as well as more powerful devices, such as smart home cameras and dashcams with hundreds of MB of memory.
